 https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/

 Table: Tree
 +-------------+------+
 | Column Name | Type |
 +-------------+------+
 | id          | int  |
 | p_id        | int  |
 +-------------+------+
 id is the primary key column for this table.
 Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
 The given structure is always a valid tree.

 Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
 "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
 "Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
 "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
 Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.

 Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.
