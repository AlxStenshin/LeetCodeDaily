 * 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List </a>
 * <p>
 * In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.
 * <p>
 * For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
 * The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.
 * <p>
 * Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.
