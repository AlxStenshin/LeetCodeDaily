/**
 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list//">
 *  328. Odd Even Linked List </a>
 * <p>
 * Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
 * <p>
 * The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
 * <p>
 * Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
 * <p>
 * You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
